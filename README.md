# User Info Pre-App Launch – Flowchart Project

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the user acquisition process for a mobile app launch using six distinct types of flowcharts. The goal of the campaign is to build a list of engaged users before the app's release by capturing leads through a landing page, automating a welcome email sequence, and tracking campaign performance.

The diagrams showcase system architecture, workflow responsibilities, data movement, conditional logic, and more. This project is part of a broader marketing and product strategy to ensure a strong app launch and warm user engagement from day one.

## Flowchart Types Included

1. **Basic Flow Chart** – High-level campaign process
2. **System Flow Chart** – Technical components and interactions
3. **Workflow Diagram** – Task sequence by team member
4. **Data Flow Chart** – How lead data moves through the system
